### About

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can easily search for articles based on their interests or queries. TrendTube offers a convenient way to explore both written news and video content in one place.

- **Combined View:** Upon searching for a topic, such as "Westminster news" users will see a news article and a relevant YouTube video. This integrated approach provides a comprehensive overview of the chosen topic.

- **Read More:** Clicking on news articles allows users to delve deeper into the details of a particular story. 

## APIs Used
